Hi, Chat! I'm trying to classify the following caption into a classification criteria. However, it seems the current criteria fails to capture certain details that would help differentiate this caption. 

Caption: {sample}  
Current Criteria: {criteria}  
Test Results: {test_results}

We are unable to classify this caption using the provided criteria due to one of the following reasons:

1. **LLM Hallucination**: If you believe the current criteria is reasonable, and the sample can be classified under one of them, the current failure may be due to LLM hallucination. 
    If the majority of classifications are correct and only a small portion of the results appears highly unreasonable, it is likely due to hallucination. In this case, please do nothing.
   - **Answer format**: {{"hallucination": []}}

2. **Hard Case**: If each classification result is reasonable on its own, but there are inconsistencies between them (i.e., the results differ but none are unreasonable), 
    this situation may be considered a "hard case" where there is no clear-cut classification. In this case, please do nothing.
   - **Answer format**: {{"hard_case": []}}

3. **Attribute Redundancy**: If there are redundant attributes in the criteria that are already covered by `test_results`, 
    please identify and replace them with a single, unified keyword that represents all the redundant attributes. 
   - **Answer format**: {{"redundant": ["unified keyword"]}}
   (Only include a **single keyword** that replaces all the redundant or duplicated attributes in relation to `test_results`).

4. **Missing Attributes**: If some important attributes are missing and need to be added to the criteria to accurately classify the caption, 
    please suggest one attribute to add.
   - **Answer format**: {{"missing": ["keyword"]}}

Please note: 
1. The content inside curly braces (e.g., {{hallucination: []}}, {{redundant: [...]}}, {{missing: [...]}}) is for our **post-processing** and should not be handled by you. 
    You only need to provide the answer in the specified format as described above. 
2. If you need to suggest a missing keyword or summarize redundant keywords, ensure that the level of granularity is consistent with the existing criteria. 
    Avoid suggesting overly broad or overly specific terms that deviate significantly from the current level.
3. When merging redundant keywords or adding new attributes, avoid incremental changes such as adding modifiers 
    (e.g., adding adjectives or descriptors like “big” or “fast” to existing keywords). 
    The new or merged keyword should reflect a distinct concept rather than a modification of an existing term.
