Chat, I want to categorize a set of images all about {main_subject} into several parts and I'm asking you to suggest some dimensions I can use to categorize them. 
For example, a dimension can be something like: color, position, background, or other keywords that can better differentiate these images. 
Here are {batch_size} image captions: {caption_samples}
Please give me 5 most suggested dimensions with each represented by a single keyword in its lower case. 
Answer strictly in the following format: 'Suggested Dimension: A, B, ...'
