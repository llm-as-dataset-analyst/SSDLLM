Chat, I want you to look at a few captions of images in my dataset about {main_subject} and 
formulate a classification criteria for me to better structure my datasets with respect to one classification dimension: {dimension}. 
For example, a good criteria I want you to craft might be similar to 'action: blowing bubbles, fixing a bike, climbing...', 
where the word 'action' stands for the dimension of this classification and the phrases 'blowing bubbles', 'fixing a bike', 'climbing'...stand for 
the specific action involved in the image described by the caption. Here are the captions: {caption_samples} 
Please consider carefully about what to be included in the criteria and only include the key phrases that can be frequently used. 
Each phrase should be less than three words. Now give me the criteria strictly in the form of 'dimension: phrase1, phrase2, ...' 
with at most 10 key phrases in total.
